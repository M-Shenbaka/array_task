# Fruit Checker and Adder

This is a simple Node.js script that allows the user to enter the name of a fruit, checks if the fruit is already in the list, and adds it if it doesn't exist. The fruit list is then sorted alphabetically and the new length of the list is displayed.

## Features

- Prompt the user to enter a fruit name.
- Check if the fruit already exists in the list.
- Add the fruit to the list if it doesn't already exist.
- Sort the list alphabetically.
- Display the sorted list and its length.

## How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a fruit name.
2. The script checks whether the entered fruit already exists in the `fruits` array.
3. If the fruit doesn't exist in the array, it is added to the list.
4. The array is sorted alphabetically.
5. The script then displays the sorted array and its length.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- `prompt-sync` module to get input from the user.
